# My Own Linux Command 

This project is all about creating own Linux command. However , many times we want to execute some
programs repediatly.In order to reduce time this script generates own Linux command for often usage of task.

### To get git version do :

``` $ git clone https://github.com/satyamz/My_Own_Linux_Command.git ```

### Documentation and usage :
You can generate everything in your local copy of My_Own_Linux_Command .

Before running the script copy the program of which you want to create a command. Here I am keeping sample C program my_program.c in My_Own_Linux_Command directory.

Now run the script command_maker.sh ,  pass arguments as my_program.c and command name like Here I am giving it as inspire.

```     $ bash command_maker.sh my_program.c inspire      ```

Congratulations :+1:  you have just created your own Linux command
